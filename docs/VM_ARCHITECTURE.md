## Two things, and they are not the same

**The prototype** is what `crates/cove-runtime/src/vm.rs` is today. It removed
recursive AST evaluation and it is faster — 1.3× to 4.2× depending on what a
program spends its time on. But it is still shaped like a flattened tree
walker: an operand is a general `Value`, a frame is a window into a `Vec` of
them, and the instruction set only recently began to say what it is operating
on.

**The target** is a typed stack machine: a slot whose type the checker proved
holds that type's own representation, a call follows a written convention over
a contiguous frame, and the heap has a layout the VM owns rather than a Rust
object graph it borrows.

The distinction matters because the prototype's numbers are being read as if
they were the ceiling of a dedicated VM, and they are not. They are the ceiling
of *this* VM. Issue #116 exists to measure the other one.

## Where the prototype's remaining cost is

Measured on `benches/arith`, a loop of integer arithmetic that allocates
nothing at all, VM backend, release build with symbols:

```
 69.70%  Vm::execute            the dispatch loop
 10.61%  interp::binary
  5.30%  drop_in_place<Value>
  0.00%  <malloc>
```

and on `benches/chars`, which allocates per character:

```
 31.39%  Vm::execute
 31.14%  <malloc>
  9.73%  builtins::call_method
  7.06%  Vec construction       an argument vector per builtin call
```

Two facts explain most of both:

```
size_of::<Value>()                = 40
needs_drop::<Value>()             = true
size_of::<Result<Value, RuntimeError>>() = 120
```

A loop that adds two integers moves 40 bytes per push, runs drop glue per pop
even for an `Int` that owns nothing, and — before typed instructions — passed
two 40-byte values into a function that returned 120 bytes to answer with an
`i64`.

`interp::binary` is down since typed instructions landed. The other two are
representation, and representation is what #116 proposed to change — see
"The slice, measured" below, where they are gone.

## The calling convention

This section describes what is built today. Where the target changes it, the
change is named.

### The stack

Two contiguous vectors for the whole run, shared by every frame: a `Vec<Value>`
and, beside it, a `Vec<i64>` for the slots and operands the checker proved are
`Int` or `Bool`. A frame is a window into both:

```rust
struct Frame {
    function: FunctionId,
    return_pc: usize,    // the instruction after the caller's `Call`
    base: usize,         // where this frame's value slots begin
    scalar_base: usize,  // where its scalar slots begin
}
```

A frame's slots are `stack[base .. base + value_frame_size]` and
`scalars[scalar_base .. scalar_base + scalar_frame_size]`, and its operands sit
above them on each. The two are numbered separately, so which stack a slot
lives in is decided by which instruction addresses it rather than by anything
read at run time. Nothing is allocated per call: the frame is four words pushed
onto a `Vec<Frame>`, and the slots are stack that already exists.

### Argument placement

Arguments are pushed onto the *caller's* operand stacks, left to right, and
become the callee's first slots without moving. So `base` is the caller's
value-operand top, read from the other side, and `scalar_base` is its
scalar-operand top read the same way.

Which of the two stacks an argument travels on is the callee's declared type,
resolved by the checker and published as `Function::params`: a parameter the
checker settled as `Int` or `Bool` is a scalar slot, so its argument is pushed
onto the scalar stack and becomes that slot, and everything else is a value
slot as before. `Call` carries the two counts rather than looking them up,
because the lowering has to place a recursive call's arguments before the
callee it is inside exists, and because the depth simulation is a function of
one instruction with no function table beside it. `validate` reconciles the
counts with the callee's own `params`, which is what makes this an invariant
rather than an agreement.

Slot order is fixed at lowering and is dense within each stack: `self` when the
function has a receiver, then each declared parameter in declaration order,
then locals and temporaries in the order the body declares them, each drawing
a number from the stack it lives in. `value_frame_size` and
`scalar_frame_size` are the high-water marks of that, not the totals, because a
block's slots are released at its end and a later sibling block reuses the
numbers.

### Return

`Function::returns` says which stack a call leaves its answer on, and it is
the same question asked of the declared return type: a function the checker
settled as answering `Int` or `Bool` answers on the scalar stack, and every
one of its returns is a `ReturnScalar`. Mixing the two in one function is a
`validate` failure, because a caller reads exactly the stack the convention
named and nothing tells it which of two a given return happened to use.

Either return pops its answer, truncates *both* stacks to the frame's bases,
pops the frame, and pushes the answer onto whichever stack it came off — which
is now the caller's. Truncating to the bases is what discards the callee's
slots and its arguments together, since they are the same storage.

A whole run still answers a `Value`, because that is the language the
embedding API speaks. So the entry's arguments cross into their stacks on the
way in and a scalar answer becomes the `Value` it stands for on the way out,
at the return that has no caller. That is the only place either conversion
happens.

### Recursion and depth

`MAX_CALL_DEPTH` bounds the frame stack, and the host's own `max_call_depth`
limit is checked in the same order the interpreter checks it, with its message.
Neither is a proof obligation; both are runtime controls.

### Errors and unwinding

There is no unwinding. A `RuntimeError` returns through Rust's `?`, carrying
the span of the instruction that raised it (`Function::span_at`). A frame that
is abandoned leaves its slots on the stack until the run ends, which is
sound because the run is ending.

*Target:* this is the one place the convention is thinner than it should be. A
run that continues past a caught failure — which Cove has no construct for
today — would need the stack truncated to the failing frame's base.

### Fuel, cancellation, and safepoints

Fuel is charged per instruction, and proportionally where an operation's cost
is not constant. A safepoint spends the accumulated fuel against the run's
shared budget and checks the deadline.

Safepoints are at: entering the entry, every call, every return, every back
edge, and every 1024 instructions of straight-line code.

A back edge reads this thread's stop flags every time — cancelling a task stops
its loop at the next turn, exactly as on the interpreter — but spends fuel only
once 64 has gathered, because spending takes a lock the tasks share and a tight
loop takes a back edge every turn.

### Host calls and reentry

A Host call goes through the same `HostRegistry` the interpreter uses, so the
grant check, the budget charge, the trace event, and the wait accounting are
the same code and cannot drift. Reentry — a host running a Cove closure — is
not yet lowered, and the convention for it is unwritten.

### Trace

`EntryEnter` and `EntryExit` are recorded with the CPU/wait split. Instructions
are not traced: an instruction-level trace would be a different artifact and
ADR 0019 does not propose one.

## What the target changes

### Compact typed slots

A slot whose type the checker proved holds that type's representation directly:
an `Int` is an integer word, a `Bool` is a word, a heap value is a reference the
VM owns. Only a slot whose type is genuinely dynamic carries a tag.

The point is negative rather than positive: `arith`'s loop should not clone,
drop, or match a general `Value` to add two integers.

**Chosen, by the measurement below: separate typed storage.** A slot the
checker settled as `Int` or `Bool` lives in a second stack of `i64` beside
the value stack, and a frame is a window into both. It was the smaller of the
two changes to try — nothing about the dynamic representation moves, so
everything the VM already ran keeps running unchanged — and on `arith` it
removed the whole of the cost it was aimed at.

**Still not chosen, and still not to be chosen without measurement:** whether
the dynamic representation is a tag beside a payload, an aligned tagged
pointer, or NaN boxing. NaN boxing in particular has to be weighed against
Cove's `Int` being a full 64 bits, which it does not fit alongside a tag.

### Frame metadata

The frame layout is where precise GC roots come from. A function's metadata
should carry, per slot, whether it holds a reference — so a collection scans
the slots that can hold one rather than inspecting every scalar as a `Value`.

That metadata exists now, and it turned out to need no per-slot list at all:
`cove_ir::Function::value_frame_size` and `scalar_frame_size` number the two
stacks separately, so a scalar slot is never a number in the value stack's
space to begin with. A frame's whole value window is its root set, with
nothing inside it to skip, because a scalar slot holds no reference by
construction and was never counted there. It is derived from the checker's
facts rather than invented, which is also what a future JIT would need.

### A VM-owned heap

Today a heap value is a Rust object graph reached through `Rc`. The target is a
layout the VM owns, reached through a stable handle. That is the largest of
these changes and the one most entangled with the embedding API, so the
embedding API should stop exposing the representation before it moves.

## The slice, and the gate

The smallest end-to-end thing worth measuring is `benches/arith` running with
typed integer and boolean instructions over compact scalar slots, with no
general `Value` operation in its hot loop, and with fuel, cancellation, trace,
diagnostics, and depth accounting unchanged — and agreeing with the AST
backend.

It is measured against both the AST backend and the prototype VM, on the same
machine and build, by: wall time, dynamic instruction count, time in dispatch,
time in clone and drop, and allocation behaviour.

**The gate:** expand the architecture across the language only if that slice
shows a material improvement attributable to it, or if profiling names a
bounded follow-up that would. If it does not, stop and record which cost
dominates instead.

That gate is the reason this document exists before the code does.

## The slice, measured

Built and measured on one machine, `--release`, `cove-bench --iterations 15`,
mean wall time:

```text
cpu    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz
os     macOS 26.5.2 (x86_64)
rustc  1.93.1 (01f6ddf75 2026-02-11)
```

"Prototype" is the VM at the commit before typed slots; "typed" is the VM with
them. The three benchmarks below are the slice and the two controls it does not
target.

| bench    | AST     | prototype VM | typed VM | typed vs prototype | typed vs AST |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| `arith`  |  458.6 ms |  263.2 ms |  106.5 ms | **2.47×** | 4.37× |
| `field`  |  867.0 ms |  649.6 ms |  604.7 ms | 1.07× | 1.45× |
| `method` | 2882.4 ms | 1047.7 ms | 1007.9 ms | 1.04× | 2.93× |

The whole suite afterwards, measured again on the same machine:

| bench       | AST      | typed VM | |
| ----------- | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| `call`      | 1592.8 ms |  326.7 ms | **4.88×** |
| `pure`      |   16.3 ms |    3.5 ms | 4.62× |
| `arith`     |  474.0 ms |  106.7 ms | 4.44× |
| `method`    | 2913.2 ms | 1002.2 ms | 2.91× |
| `chars`     | 1909.6 ms |  872.2 ms | 2.19× |
| `arrayget`  | 1480.6 ms |  729.5 ms | 2.03× |
| `field`     |  883.2 ms |  606.0 ms | 1.46× |
| `hostheavy` |    4.9 ms |    3.8 ms | 1.29× |

`hostheavy` is the floor and should be: it is host dispatch, which both
backends reach through the same registry, so there is nothing there for an
execution model to win.

Dynamic instruction count, from `cove run --stats`:

| bench    | prototype  | typed      |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `arith`  | 31,142,876 | 31,142,877 |
| `field`  | 43,428,594 | 53,714,311 |
| `method` | 55,428,597 | 65,714,314 |

`arith`'s loop is the same nineteen instructions it was; the one added
instruction is the `scalar-to-value` that hands `total` to `assertEqual`
after the loop has ended. `field` and `method` run *more* instructions —
their operands are struct fields and call results, so every typed operator is
now bracketed by boundary instructions — and are faster anyway, because a
boundary instruction is cheaper than the `Value` traffic it replaced.

The profile of `arith` on the typed VM, same sampling as above:

```
 85.07%  Vm::execute            the dispatch loop
  4.22%  HostRegistry::with_budget
  3.67%  Vm::back_edge
  0.00%  drop_in_place<Value>
  0.00%  Value::clone
  0.00%  <malloc>
```

Against the prototype's profile of the same program on the same machine —
70.21% dispatch, 12.81% `drop_in_place<Value>`, 3.34% `Value::clone`, 6.24%
`promised_int`, 0.00% malloc — the whole of the representation cost is gone
rather than reduced: 16.2% of the run was cloning and dropping a `Value` and
now none of it is. No `Value` clone or drop remains in `arith`'s loop at all,
which `the_arith_bench_loop_builds_no_value_it_does_not_use` asserts
statically as well: every instruction between the loop's test and its jump
back takes nothing off the value stack and puts nothing back.

**The gate passes.** The improvement is 2.47× on the slice, it is
attributable to the architecture rather than to a peephole — the instruction
count did not move — and the two controls the slice does not target did not
regress.

What dominates now is dispatch, which was always the other half of the
prototype's profile and is now 85% of a run 2.5× shorter. That is the next
thing to be measured against, not this one.

Both follow-ups the profile named have since been taken, and they were one
change. A parameter's slot and a return value's stack are now the declared
type's to decide, which is the calling convention described above; and an
`Int`-typed `if`/`else`, `match`, or block is lowered in scalar position
rather than built as a `Value` in each branch for a boundary instruction to
unwrap again — the second is what the first needs to be worth anything, since
a function whose body is a tail `if` would otherwise have paid back at its
return what its parameters saved. `benches/pure`'s `fib` and `benches/call`'s
`identity` hold no boundary instruction at all now, where `fib` had eight of
twenty-four.

What the convention does not reach is what still lowers on the value path
either way. `&&` and `||` short-circuit through the value stack's jumps, so a
`Bool` parameter crosses to be tested and the answer crosses back; `!` and
unary `-` have no scalar form; and a builtin method or a host operation
answers a `Value` whatever its type, because both are the interpreter's own
code and the interpreter speaks `Value`. Each is a boundary instruction where
a value really does meet something general, which is what the boundary is for
— and none of them is what a profile now names.
